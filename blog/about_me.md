I am an EMR manager in a community health center in Honolulu, HI. I was with all aspects of electronic medical records. My day to day activity varies from build forms for medical staff, streamlining data entry workflow for clinical team, building reports for management or working on servers and network like any other systems administrator. I do not have any specialty, I am jack of all but master of none. I love what I do and I respect what my organization does, serve the under-previledge.

Undergrad in Minnesota and masters in UH. One more class to go.

Besides work, I have learnt to love running. It started few years ago with a 26 mile, 9 hour marathon without training to running 3-4 times a week, abiet smaller runs of 5 miles or less. I am not a fast runner but I am steady and I persist once I set my mind to it.

I love to eat and cook. I am not picky when it comes to food, even though I prefer not to eat certain types of food, especially sweet and spicy. I would try most other food. I also love to cook and I love experimenting. My cooking is hit and a miss. Sometimes I cook so good that I amaze myself and sometimes it is so bad that I think I should give up cooking completely. I do not have any sense of how much seasoning food needs. I put same amount of salt and spices whether I am cooking for myself or 7 guests or cooking for a week, I sometimes dabble with meal plans for the whole week.

I love eating out and taking pictures of my food. I contribute it on google for others to see and someday get something in return. I have collected lot of points in google contribution. I am a local guide, level 6 and close to getting on level 7. I do not know what i am expecting out this. People contribute to yelp but I do it on google. The pictures definitely help me remember the food I have had and places I have tried.

I love learning, I probably love learning more that putting it to use. I have spent hours upon hours learning. It is mostly on youtube and podcasts. I have learnt lot a of different programming over the years. I start a course but never complete it. It started with CCNA and it continues to this day. I never got certified for CCNA but I know the basics, just enough to cause trouble if I spend too much time with switches and router and just enough to understand the network and fix minor issues at work if needed.

I am an immigrant, working in US on H1B visa. My employers were gracious enough to sponsor me for green card which is in its final stages. Once the paperwork is completed, I plan to open an LLC and go full on with investment.

I tried my hands in AirBnB for a year which was profitable but did not end of well before shutting it down. That was a valuable lesson.

Lately, I have been reading "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki. Halfway through the book, I am highly motivated build my asset column. I am looking for real estate deals in Honolulu and I open up accounts in Vanguard, Betterment, Fidelity, Robinhood, which is an overkill but I was excited about trading stocks.

I watch financial advisors on youtube and slowly understanding the way money works. I started out with awful credit history and unable to open a checking account to respectability with few credit cards. It started with a secured credit card towards the end of 2015. Since then I have been researching and working on building back my credit. 

It took years of working before I was able to pay off my debt, first with family and friends and then the past default debt and finally student debt. Most of the money I earned went towards paying off debt. I could have paid off sooner if I was more frugal but after 7 years of steady job and steady increase in pay I was finally able to pay off all my debt. Now it time to take some risk

This blog is about my journey. I do not have a destination but I want to be happy as I travel the road unknown. I want to know enough about medicine and technology to help the medical staff at my work who work hard for the patients with some complaints about the system they have to work with. It could lead me to learning machine learning and AI, which could be interesting. I want to run marathon in under 4 hours some day, this year my goal is under 5 hours, 6 hour is the best I have done. I love cooking and eating and someday I hope to be a decent cook. I am an immigrant so life of an immigrant would be reflected here. And finally this blog will be my attempt to get financial stability. Oh and I want to have a decent beach body and I plan to join a gym. I have too many interests, like most people and I am privelidged enough to take time to document my life going forward as a 33 year old immigrant working hard to make it.
