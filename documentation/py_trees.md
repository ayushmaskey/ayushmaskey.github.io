## Closure
> a method for combining data values satisfies the closure property if
 * the result of combination can itself be combined using same method
 * if I can put an item into list, I should be able to take that list and put it into different list.
 * permits us to create hierarchical structures
 * Hierarchiacal structure are made up of parts, which themselves are made up of parts and so on
 * Lists can contain lists as element in addition to anything else
 * box and pointer
 
## box and pointer notation
 * lists are represented as row of index-label adjacent boxes one per element
 * each box either contains a primitive value or points to a compound value
 * pair = [1,2] --> pair is pointing to list 
 * nested_list = [ [1, 2], [], [ [3, False, None], [4, lambda:5] ] ]
