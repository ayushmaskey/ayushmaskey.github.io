#Malware Threat

1. Create HTTP Trojan and Remotely Controlling a target machine using HTTP RAT
* HTTP RAT trojan
* create httpserver in target machine
* access/ control all services, file system, hardware and software info for target machine

2. Creating Trojan Server Using GUI Trojan MoSucker
* MoSucker
* fake error message created when user clicks in executable
* live capture
* key logger
* access file system

3. Gaining control over a victim machine using njRAT
* njRAT
* access file system, kill and delete processes, modify registry, modify services, access cmd line
* execute files remotely, RDP
* access camera and microphone 
* key logger
* send message to target machine on a chat window that can only be closed by hacker
* connection re-extablished even after target machine is rebooted

4. Creating a Trojan server using ProRat Tool
* ProRat 1.9 SE.exe
* bind trojan to images
* use custom icon
* connect to victim's machine
* monitor user activity, key logger

5. Creating a Trojan server using Teef
* Theef 
* keylogger, screen capture

6. Attaining Remote Access using Atelier Web Remote Commander
* Atelier
* manage remote machine without software installation
* need credential for the target machine - obtained in previous labs
* extablish RDP with victim machine
* get shared resources, active routes, gateway, DNS, netmask, file system, users and groups

7. Building a Botnet Infracture using Umbra Loader
* create command and control center for botnet using umbra
* basics of botnet infrastructure
* remotely execute any application - could be used by IT department

8. Creating a virus using JPS Virus Maker Tool
* JPS Virus maker 3.0
* GUI virus maker that has options to embed functionalities
* option to convert virus into worm 


9. Creating a Worm using Ghost Eye Worm and maintaining a Persistent Connection using njRAT
* work - self replicating 
* create trojan with njRAT
* encrypt trojan with swayzcryptor
* build worm with ghost eye with embeded trojan
* embed the worm in social media comment to spread the worm and trojan

10. Creating a Worm Using the internet Worm Maker Thing
* construct worm with specific options
* 

11. Virus Analysis Using OllyDbg
* Analyze virus
* upload suspicious file in OllyDbg
* give log data, executable modules, memory mapping and thread of the virus

12. Detcting Trojans
* trojan difficult to detect
* monitoring ports and processes using TCPView can be useful tool
* TCPView shows processes along with remote and local IP and port numbers
* monitor processes, DLLs and services using Autoruns
* Autoruns show all the apps, explorer apps , services, drivers, known DLLs that run at startup
* compare known stuff with all the processes running the machine and kill those that are not known
* clean registry, log files, temp files using jv16 powertools
* jv16 powertools can help control which apps run automatically
* other clean up tools available in jv16 - file, registry, system, privacy and backup


13. Monitoring TCP/IP Connections using CurrPorts
* currPorts get details of each connection
* kill that connection or close the TCP connection to close port

Summary
* many ways to create trojan server
* create malware, botnet, virus, worms
* UAC should not be turned down
* analyse virus
* monitor ports, DLLs, processes, services, registry, log files, temp files and TCP/IP connections
