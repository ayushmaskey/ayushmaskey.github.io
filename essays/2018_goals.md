I have two goals for 2018. Complete marathon at my personal best times and graduate from school.

#### Marathon
I have participated in 3 different marathon so far. 2013 was my [first marathon](./FirstMarathon.md). The next two were exactly 6 hours. For 2018 my goal is to complete the marathon in 4 hour 30 minutes and I have began training early this year. 


So the goal is to run 26 miles in 270 minutes or 10.39 minutes per miles. There is bound be some water breaks so I need to average 10 minutes per mile. Race starts at 5am and the sun rises around 7am, so I need to run as much as I can in the first two hours. If I could get to 13 mile mark in those two hours, then 4 hours 30 minutes seems feasible. I need to be as fast as 9 minutes per mile for the first two hours which leaves me with 11.5 per miles for last half of the marathon.

Plan of action is to run 3 days a week all year around. I need to run 3-5 miles twice a week after work, gradually increase speed and a weekend run of 10-15 miles for stamina. I will have atleast one friend to run along with me for training as well as during the marathon. I have trained and run all 3 marathon with him. 

The training for marathon has already begun and this is the earliest we have started training. In the last 2 weeks we ran 4 times, 3 miles each with a week off between Christmas and New Years. Those 4 runs have been come after a long haitus of 4-5 months. The times have varied between 10 min/miles to 11.5 min/mile. As I browse through mapmyrun app, it seems like I have run as fast as 8:5 min/ mile for 4.5 miles but that speed is few and far between. Also the longest non-race run , I can find is 10 miles at 12 min/ mile. The goal for 2018 is to have personal best in all categories.

There is more to training than just running regularly. Workout will include weekly visit to ala moana beach park for some push ups and pull ups and some youtube yogas.

Besides training, I need to watch what I eat. I have gained over 10 lb since the last time I was training regularly. I plan to lose 20 lb and get to 150 which has been ideal weight for me. Moreover, smoking less, hopefully quitting, and cutting down on execssive beer has to be part of my training regiment.
