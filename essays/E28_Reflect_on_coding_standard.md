I have had to review and modify previously written codes at work. It maybe to add additional features or fix bugs created by change in business logic. Understanding someone else's code takes time and in my experience, if there were multiple contributors, it usually takes twice as long for the same lines of codes. And I have never had to read weakly typed functional programming language and I imagine it takes a lot more time to review them.

This is where coding standard alleviates some of the headache even though it is annoying to follow them. Nagging squiggly red line over position of curly braces sounds annoying but when I go through someone else’s code the position of those gnarly curly braces do help. It is easier to locate the start and the end of the code block, which it turn makes the code easier to read. And then there is a squiggly line for missing a space or too many spaces but it does give a cleaner look. Besides readability, some of the standards helps debug errors. I would have loved it if there was standard imposed on for variable names as well. 

All that being said, I am very bad when it comes to following coding standards. I make up standards as I go and forget previous standards I made up. And then there is refactoring and updating all the old codes with new standards, but who has time for that. The only time for refactoring is when something is broken or there is a need for additional features and I have no other option but to go back to that piece of code. After a semester of using eslint, I am hopeful that I may just develop some good coding habits and my future self will thank me for my clean code. I am optimistic that at the end of the semester when I look back at the code I write going forward doesn’t take as long as to decipher compared the code I wrote in the past. 

Every programmer has different style and different coding experience. Experienced programmer usually follow a set of standards whether it is global standard or a personal standard. Following coding standard is not about following one perfect standard, no such thing exists. It is about picking a set of standards and everyone in the team following it.
