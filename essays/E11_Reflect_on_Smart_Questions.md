[This link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25465407/sql-insert-into-select-query?answertab=oldest#tab-top) is an example of simple but smart question. The poster had a very simple SQL question about inserting some column(s) from one table to another. There are many instruction available online on how this can be accomplished. I think it is a smart question because he said he found instructions on how to achieve this online but did not understand how it worked. Moreover, he took time to describe / draw out table in the initial state as well as final state after the desired update statement. He got the help he needed with a complete syntax to achieve his goal as well as brief explanation on how those statements work all within 2 minutes of posting the question.

On the other hand, [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5979534/javascript-uncaught-typeerror) is an example of not so smart question. His initial question was he needed help with TypeError in javascript/jquery and a link to his website. When people in stackoverflow asked for more details, he finally posted some code with not much details.  The generous people in stackoverflow did look at the code and his website and recommended few possible things to look at. The exact cause of the error was never identified because he didnâ€™t provide enough information at any point before the thread was closed.

Both have good heading that describe the body of message posted. Smart question expanded on the heading and added details in the body of the question. The not so smart question had good heading but the initial question in the body did not expand on the heading.
