I had never used semantic UI or twitter bootstrap before this week. Managing basic wordpress site for couple of weeks is the extent of my knowledge when it comes to web development. I am definitely impressed that one week of HTML/CSS and one week of semantic-ui was enough to develop a half decent mock webpage. It is telling that an hour of work was enough to create a decent imitation of many popular websites.
 
That being said, the best thing about framework is its modularity. I was impressed to read that each component was accompanied by individual stylesheet and javascript. This would definitely cut down on page load time if designed right. Consistency is another area where the framework excels. Multiple elements share decoratives like type and variation which reduces the overall vocabulary size of the framework. Moreover, those decoratives are applied to collections and views to maintain consistency across the framework when possible. And for the most part the resulting mock up were as expected but there were times during the WOD and homework when it was frustrating as things didnâ€™t align as I anticipated. 

This is especially true when when it comes to interactive elements dropdowns. It is by far the biggest problem I had with semantic-ui. A statement of javascript required for dropdown could have been included in semantic.*.js with possibility of overload for anything beyond basic. The other quibble I have is lack of responsiveness. A stackable horizontal menu converts to vertical menu when the screen width is reduced but throws off positioning of other elements in the page. I could not find a simple way to create a hamburger menu, which I assume twitter bootstrap excels at since it is known for its responsiveness.

Finally, support for the framework was good and bad experience. On one hand, lack of vibrant discussion in forums like stackoverflow is a hindrance. This is probably because the framework is just over a year old and still developing and maturing. On the other hand the elaborate documentation on semantic-ui website was very helpful with multiple examples of customizing elements.
