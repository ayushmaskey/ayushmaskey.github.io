I am a newbie when it comes to Javascript and topics covered so far has been fairly straightforward with loops and conditional statements. It is somewhat similar to python in that both are weakly typed language and both are very powerful. The biggest problem I have had so far with Javascript has been learning the syntax. As a simple example, some languages require “if then else if” which I am used to and always I tend to include “then” even in javascript. After going through 10 hours of var in freecodecamp, I have been a little forgetful when it comes to using let to define a variable. 

It looks like basics knowledge of Javascript is enough to get a website up and running. Seeing the work pay off fast would keep me motivated to keep going. However, basic knowledge of a powerful to get started, weakly typed language and public facing website seems like recipe for disaster. On a personal level, I am not a big proponent of weakly typed languages.

I took ICS 311 last semester with flipped classroom environment and it was useful for me since I can go through the material at my convenience. I work full time and I might not be at my most attentive at 6pm after 8 hours of work.  Athletic software engineering seems to take the concept of flipped classroom to the next level. The first week was slightly confusing and I missed the most basic assignments of linkedin and techhui for easy grades but I am getting hang of it now. The first two weeks have been pretty straightforward but I expect things to get stressful over the course of the semester.

WODs have been simple so far since the course material has barely started. While flipped classes rooms lets me go through the material at my convenience, WODs will definitely keep me honest as there is no room for procrastination. I think I will enjoy athletic software engineering and WODs even if it will definitely be a challenge over the semester. On the other hand, writing will probably be my biggest adversary for the semester. I am not a good writer and a slow one at that but it will be a good practice to try and communicate my thoughts that are understandable to readers.

Finally, I will have to think of ways to implement WODs for future learning which might help me keep in track. When I learn something new, I work hard for a month or so and start slacking off. Finding ways to implement WODs in my regiment might help me push through that hurdle.
